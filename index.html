                                        <p class="mainArticle">This is a simple program that was used to demonstrate object oriented programming. There were six classes that made up this program
                                        including: Person, Student, Undergraduate, Graduate, TestStudent, and ReadWriteFile. The main objective was to prompt the user to either
                                        1, write data to a file; 2, read data from a file; 3, exit. If the user selected 1, they would be selected to enter a .txt file and enter
                                        the student's first name, last name, math SAT score, verbal SAT score, writing SAT score, and their highschool GPA. Then the user was prompted
                                        to enter a college decision, 1 for accepted, 2 for rejected, 3 for being on a waiting list, and 4 for no decision.</p>

                                        the structure is then cleared. To prove that it wrote to the file, it then prints the contents out again.</p>

                                <p class="mainArticle">This project was an assignment for class. The main purpose was to redesign an application or website's appearance. For this project
                                    I chose Craigslist. I was familiar with Craigslist and the outdated, HTML-esque appearance. What I did was utilized my basic HTML and CSS (along with
                                    Bootstrap) to visually make things more round, definite, and clean. I changed to font, as well as removed a lot of the extra things the website has to
                                    offer that nobody would use today. I added a built-in messenger to appeal to those who use other selling platforms. This was the first time using
                                    HTML and CSS in a long time, so it was a good refresher. Most of the same principles that went into this project have been used in the development
                                    of this portfolio.

                     He wanted to learn more about building computers so I showed him how. 
                     This was the early stages and I can be seen cable managing. This was my first

                    cost so much, every opportunity given, I will gladly build a computer.
